üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Operation: Mr. Robot Infiltration
Type: CTF-style Pentest Lab
Target IP: 192.168.254.133
Attacker IP (Kali): 192.168.254.131
Platform: VulnHub ‚Äì Mr. Robot VM
Author: RootProwler
Date: April 2025

üß† Executive Summary
This engagement simulates a black-box external penetration test targeting a vulnerable WordPress site. The objective was to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges internally, and exfiltrate sensitive flag data ‚Äî simulating a full-chain attack.

The target was successfully compromised using a combination of misconfigured WordPress components and weak system passwords. The test concluded with full root access and capture of all three flags.

üîß Technical Summary

‚úÖ Conclusion
This test confirmed that weak administrative credentials, misconfigured WordPress themes, and local privilege escalation via SUID binaries can lead to full system compromise. The organization should implement stronger password policies, regularly update plugins/themes, and restrict SUID binary access.
