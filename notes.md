# Personal Notes - Mr. Robot Pentest Project

## Overview

This document captures all relevant notes, thoughts, and observations made during the **Mr. Robot Pentest Project**, simulating a black-box external penetration test. The goal was to exploit vulnerabilities in the target system (WordPress-based site running on Apache) and escalate privileges to gain full system control. These notes are part of my methodology and learning process, helping me improve my offensive security skills.

## Objectives

1. **External Penetration Test**: Conduct a simulated attack to compromise the web server.
2. **Privilege Escalation**: From initial access (www-data) to privileged access (root).
3. **Capture Flags**: Collect flags placed on the system as part of the challenge.

---

## Network Setup

- **Attacker**: Kali Linux (192.168.254.130)
- **Target**: Mr. Robot (192.168.254.133)
- **Network Mode**: Bridged mode to ensure machines are in the same network.

## Enumeration Phase

The enumeration phase is crucial to understanding the target system. The following tools and techniques were used to gather information.

### Nmap Scan

A thorough Nmap scan was conducted to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities:

```bash
nmap -sS -A -p- 192.168.254.133
```

**Results:**

- Open port: 80 (Apache HTTPD)
- WordPress site identified at the root (/)

### Web Directory Enumeration (Gobuster)

Gobuster was used to identify hidden files or directories that may provide further attack vectors.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.254.133 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

**Results:**

- Discovered /wp-login.php, /license.txt, /robots.txt

**Insight:** WordPress login page accessible, which is a potential target for brute force.

---

## Exploitation Phase

### WordPress Login Brute Force Attack (Hydra)

Since the WordPress login page was discovered during enumeration, a brute force attack was conducted using Hydra with a common password list (rockyou.txt).

```bash
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.254.133 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log In:S=Dashboard"
```

**Outcome:**

- Cracked credentials: `admin:welcome`
- Logged into the WordPress Dashboard, gaining administrator access.

### Web Shell Upload

Once inside WordPress, I exploited the 404.php template of the Twenty Fifteen theme to upload a PHP reverse shell.

- Modified `404.php` to include reverse shell code from PentestMonkey's PHP Reverse Shell.
- Listener was set up on Kali Linux:

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

- Triggered the shell by navigating to:

```bash
http://192.168.254.133/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/404.php
```

**Result:**

- Successfully received a reverse shell with user `www-data`.

---

## Privilege Escalation Phase

### From www-data to robot

While exploring the filesystem, I found a file called `password.raw-md5` in the `/home/robot` directory. This file appeared to contain an MD5 hash that might represent the user's password.

- Cracked the MD5 hash using an online tool like CrackStation.
- The password for `robot` was cracked: `robot1234`
- Logged in as `robot` using the cracked password.

### From robot to root

After gaining access as `robot`, I searched for SUID binaries, which could potentially allow privilege escalation. Used the following command:

```bash
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```

- Discovered the `nmap` binary with the SUID bit set: `/usr/local/bin/nmap`
- Ran `nmap` with the `--interactive` flag to spawn a shell with root privileges:

```bash
nmap --interactive
!sh
```

**Result:**

- Gained full root access to the system.

---

## Flag Capture

Once root access was achieved, I captured all three flags that were part of the challenge.

- `flag1.txt`: `073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9`
- `flag2.txt`: `822c73956184f694993bede3eb39f959`
- `root-flag.txt`: `04787ddef27c3dee1ee161b21670b4e4`

---

## Post-Exploitation & Clean-Up

Once the flags were captured, I ensured that all traces of my actions were wiped from the system to avoid leaving any backdoors or logs. This step is vital in a real-world scenario to prevent detection.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Reconnaissance**: Thorough enumeration is critical. Identifying misconfigurations and weak points early on can accelerate exploitation.
- **WordPress Weaknesses**: WordPress sites with weak or default credentials are an easy target for brute force attacks. Regular password hygiene and account lockout policies are necessary to mitigate this.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Always check for SUID binaries and other potential escalation vectors after gaining initial access.
- **Web Shells**: Modifying web templates, such as `404.php`, is an effective way to upload shells when the site is misconfigured.

---

## Areas for Improvement

- **Faster Brute Force**: In the future, I will consider using more optimized wordlists or tools like Burp Suite to speed up the process.
- **Detection Evasion**: I will practice more advanced evasion techniques such as time-based shell creation, avoiding obvious file names, and clearing logs more effectively.

---

## Conclusion

This pentest was an excellent opportunity to practice full-chain attack techniquesâ€”from web exploitation to internal privilege escalation. The target system had multiple vulnerabilities, including weak credentials and misconfigured WordPress themes, which were leveraged to gain full root access. Moving forward, I plan to document more specific countermeasures for each vulnerability and integrate them into my overall security improvement strategies.
